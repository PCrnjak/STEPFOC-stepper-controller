## 📖 Project Overview

**STEPFOC** is a FOC based stepper motor controller designed to deliver affordable, high-performance hardware paired with powerful open-source software. Its mission is to transform low-cost stepper motors into high-performance robotic servos, enabling advanced robotics applications without the high price tag.

The controller features a 14-bit magnetic encoder, inline current sensing, CAN and UART interfaces, and supports position, velocity, torque, and impedance control modes.

> [!NOTE]
> You can now tune your motors via [https://motorgui.com/](https://motorgui.com/)

> [!NOTE]
> Optimized for NEMA17 format but it can also be attached to nema 23 and 14 steppers!


> [!IMPORTANT]
>     **STEPFOC stepper driver is built on the same hardware and software foundation as the Spectral Micro BLDC driver. As a result, some references or images in this documentation may still show the Spectral Micro, since both drivers share about 99% of their features. They also use the same CAN and UART command sets, with only minor differences in UART-based calibration and setup procedures.**
